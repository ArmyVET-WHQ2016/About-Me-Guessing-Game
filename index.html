                Hi!<br>
                My name is Nicholas Leonard and I live in the Cayman Islands. I have grown up in the British education
                system, taking my IGCSEs and A level exams in high school.
                I am currently working on getting my bachelor's degree in computer science at the the University College
                of the Cayman Islands. I grew up on the Islands, playing tennis
                and baseball, and enjoying the clear waters and beaches. I am looking forward to learning about
                Javascript and HTML.
