            Hi!<br>
            My name is Nicholas Leonard and I live in the Cayman Islands. I have grown up in the British education system, taking my IGCSEs and A level exams in high school. 
            I am currently working on getting my bachelor's degree in computer science at the the University College of the Cayman Islands. I grew up on the Islands, playing tennis
            and baseball, and enjoying the clear waters and beaches. I am looking forward to learning about Javascript and HTML.
